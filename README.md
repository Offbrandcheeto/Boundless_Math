Boundless Math is an infinite math operations game that automatically adjusts to your skill level as you play. Correct answers will bring tougher problems, while incorrect ones will make the problems easier. Your journey begins with addition and advances through subtraction, multiplication, and, finally division. Once you complete division, the game returns to addition and starts the cycle over again. However, the problems will be more challenging than they were the previous time around. Each cycle will push you further, gradually building your skills and talents. It'll be a challenge, but as you keep putting in the work and showing up, you'll discover that your potential is truly boundless!
