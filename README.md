Parker Math is a math operations game that adjusts its difficulty based on your performance, challenging you with harder problems when you answer correctly and moving back to easier ones if you start getting them wrong. Your journey begins with addition, progressing to subtraction, multiplication, and eventually division. By design, the game doesn't save your progress, enabling you to revisit concepts and reinforce your learning. As you play, you'll earn "Snow" for each correct answer, which you can spend in the shop to open packs of collectible penguin cards.
