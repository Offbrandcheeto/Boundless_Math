Parker Math is a dynamic math operations game that automatically adjusts to your skill level as you play. The difficulty of the questions will change based on your performance. Correct answers will result in more challenging problems, while incorrect answers will lead to easier problems. Your journey begins with addition and advances through subtraction, multiplication, and, finally division. Once you complete division, the game returns to addition and starts the cycle over again. However, the problems will be more challenging than they were in the previous cycle. But don't doubt yourself. You can do this, and you'll be amazed at where you end up if you practice a little each day!
