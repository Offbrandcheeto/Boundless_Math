    <h2>Why Should I Do This?</h2>
       <div class="border">
       <p class="text-p">"We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too." This John F. Kennedy quote is one of my favorites of all time. Every significant achievement in history has been accomplished by a person or group that took on a challenge others laughed at and said couldn't be done. They said, "It's too hard. It's a dream. There's no way you could do that."</p>
       <p class="text-p">But people no different than you or I took a dream and made it happen by embracing the challenge in front of them. They didn't look at failure as a bad thing. They sought it out and cherished it. Every broken lightbulb, fried circuit, and failed test launch wasn't a step back but a step forward. They silenced the noise of others and kept going until they completed something incredible that altered the world forever.</p>
       <p class="text-p">Parker Math is not a math facts website. It's a website designed to teach you to embrace failure and learn from it to push yourself forward. I hope that by playing this game, you will learn your math facts and build the foundation for your future math and academic skills to grow, but that is not my main purpose. The game is programmed to challenge you and have you fail every time you play until you complete it. That may sound scary and daunting, but only by getting out of your comfort zone and pushing yourself can you make real and lasting growth. Failure is your friend. In this game, you will learn to embrace and use it to your advantage, just like the great minds of the past and present. </p>
       <p class="text-p">I invite you on this journey, and I hope you stay along for the ride because you will be amazed at what you're capable of. Do your best, ask questions, study, research, and good things will happen. Your math skills will improve, but most importantly, your mindset will improve. </p>
