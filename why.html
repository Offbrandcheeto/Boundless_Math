          "We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this
          decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
          because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and
          measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge
          is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
          postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          This John F. Kennedy quote is one of my favorites of all time. Every
          major achievement in history has been accomplished by a person
          or group that took on a challenge others laughed at and said
          couldn't be done. The doubters said, "It's too hard. It's a dream. 
          There's no way you could do that."
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          But people no different than you or I took a dream and made it
          happen by embracing the challenge in front of them. They didn't look
          at failure as a bad thing. They sought it out and cherished it.
          Every broken lightbulb, fried circuit, and failed test launch wasn't
          a step back but a step forward. They silenced the noise of others
          and kept going until they completed something incredible that
          altered the world forever.

          build the foundation for your future academic skills to grow. However,
          that's not the main goal. The true purpose of this game is to have you
          face challenges and fail each time you play. Taking on these challenges
          will teach you that long-lasting growth only comes from tackling difficult 
          tasks and embracing failure. Boundless Math will train you to embrace challenges, 
          just like the great minds of the past and present.
