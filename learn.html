        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">How To Add</h3>
        <p class="text-p">When you add numbers together, think of it as figuring out how many items you have in total. For example, if you have 10 baseball cards and buy 5 more, you will have 15 cards. Similarly, if you have 10 pieces of candy and buy 15 more, you will have 25 pieces of candy in total. When you add numbers, you line them up based on their place value and start adding from the rightmost column. If the sum of two numbers is greater than 10, you subtract 10 from that number and carry over 1 to the next column. For example, let's add 16 + 17. We start by adding the numbers in the ones column: 6 + 7 equals 13. We write down the 3 in the one's place and carry over the 1 to the tens column. Then we add the numbers in the tens column, and the carried 1: 1 + 1 + 1 equals 3. So, the answer is 33. This is the basic idea of addition—you find the total amount when you combine two or more quantities.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">How To Subtract</h3>
        <p class="text-p">When you subtract numbers, think of it as figuring out how many items are left over after taking some away. For example, if you have 15 baseball cards and give 7 away, you will have 8 cards left. Similarly, if you have 25 pieces of candy and eat 12, you will have 13 pieces of candy left (and a stomach ache). When you subtract numbers, you line them up based on their place value and start subtracting from the rightmost column. If the number at the top is smaller than the number at the bottom, you can borrow from the next column. For example, let's take 72 and subtract 35 from it. We start by subtracting the numbers in the one's column: 2 - 5. Since 2 is smaller than 5, we borrow 1 from the tens column, making it 12 - 5, which equals 7. Then, we subtract the numbers in the tens column: 6 - 3, which equals 3. So, the answer is 37. This is the basic idea of subtraction—finding the amount that remains after one quantity is subtracted from another.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">How To Multiply</h3>
        <p class="text-p">When you multiply numbers, think of it as combining groups of items to find out the total amount. For example, if you have 5 packs of baseball cards, each containing 3 cards, you can multiply 5 by 3 to determine that you have 15 cards. Similarly, if you have 4 bags of candy with 6 pieces in each bag, you multiply 4 by 6 to find out that you have 24 pieces of candy. When you multiply numbers, you line them up based on their place value and start multiplying from the rightmost digit of the bottom number with each digit of the top number. For example, let's multiply 31 by 3. We begin by multiplying the digits in the one's column: 3 x 1 equals 3. Then, we multiply the numbers in the tens column: 3 x 3 equals 9. So, the answer is 93. This is the basic idea of multiplication—combining groups to find the total amount.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">How To Divide</h3>
        <p class="text-p">When you divide numbers, think of it as splitting a group of items into equal parts to find out how many items are in each part. For example, if you have 15 baseball cards and want to divide them into 3 equal groups, you divide 15 by 3 to find out that each group has 5 cards. Similarly, if you have 24 pieces of candy and want to share them equally among 6 friends, you divide 24 by 6 to determine that each friend gets 4 pieces. When you divide numbers, you place the dividend (the number being divided) inside the division bracket and the divisor (the number you are dividing by) outside. For example, let's divide 72 by 3. We see how many times 3 fits into the leading digit of 72, which is 7. It fits 2 times. Write 2 above the bracket, multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, and subtract 6 from 7 to get 1. Bring down the next digit, 2, to make 12. Now, see how many times 3 fits into 12, which is 4. Write 4 above the bracket and subtract 12 from 12 to get 0. So, the answer is 24. This is the basic idea of division—splitting a quantity into equal parts to determine how many items are in each part or how many parts you can make. Division is the inverse of multiplication. Use this to your advantage when solving problems.</p>

      <h2 class="text-heading-large">Tips For Success</h2>
      <div class="border">
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #1: Failure Is The Key</h3>
        <p class="text-p">If you've read the "Why?" section, you've already seen that the theme of this game is embracing failure and viewing it as a positive experience that helps you learn. I want you to learn your math facts, but most importantly, I want you to build an unbreakable mindset that sets you up for success in the future. The game's programming will help you practice this as it will try to adjust to your skill level as fast as possible. This programming makes it so that there will come a point every time you play where things will get tough, and you will have to work hard and fail in order to learn how to solve the problems you are facing. The key is to look at this struggle and the questions you get wrong as steps in the right direction. If you can do this, it will put you on the path to learning your math facts quickly and, most importantly, on the path to success for the rest of your life.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #2: Just Breathe</h3>
        <p class="text-p">When things get tough, it's easy for your mind to shut down and give up on you. A way that you can combat this frustration in these moments of stress is to practice breathing techniques to get into a calmer and better state of mind. If you can calm down and refocus, it will make facing these challenges more manageable and allow you to grow. The technique that I want to teach you is the 3-3-3 technique. Start by taking a straight, relaxed posture in your chair and lightly close your eyes. Begin by taking a 3-second inhale through your nose. Then hold your breath for another 3 seconds and then slowly release the breath out through your mouth for 3 seconds. Repeat this process 5-10 times, and your mind should be more relaxed and ready to tackle the challenges in front of you. </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #3: Set Limits</h3>
        <p class="text-p">There's a fine line between pushing yourself to improve and pushing yourself too hard. If you begin to get frustrated and feel stuck after carefully reviewing how the operation you're on works and after you do the breathing instructions in tip #2, it means it's time for a break. Taking a break is perfectly fine. Your brain needs breaks to recharge and review the learning you accomplished. When you have some free time and feel like your brain is fresh, return to the game and try to progress past the point where you got stuck. You will be surprised that after taking a break, you will come back and be able to answer questions easier and perhaps progress further into the game.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #4: Practice Everyday</h3>
        <p class="text-p">Repetition is the key to learning new skills or developing a new mindset. Try to find time every day to play this game. Whether it's for 5, 10, 20, or 30+ minutes doesn't matter at first. The key is to build the daily habit and routine of playing. After doing this for a while, you will build up knowledge and stamina, making it easier to play the game for extended periods. If you enjoy playing and do an hour every day at first, that is totally fine. If you are struggling and it's taking a lot of energy out of you, 5 minutes a day is totally fine. Do whatever amount of time allows you to build the habit of playing every day, and you will gradually grow your skills at your own pace.</p>
