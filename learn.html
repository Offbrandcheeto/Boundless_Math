        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">What Is Addition?</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          Addition is adding numbers or different items that you want to count together. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Imagine that you have 2 apples, and then your friend gives you 3 more. How many apples do you have now?
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          We'll create an addition problem to find the answer. First, we'll identify the addends, which are the numbers that get added together.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The addends in this problem are 2 and 3, so we can begin creating our addition problem: 2 + 3 =
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Now, all we have to do is find the total or the sum of the numbers. We can now solve the problem by finding the sum of the addends: 2 + 3 = 5
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The key to mastering addition is to memorize adding the numbers from 0-10. This will give you a solid foundation and allow you to solve any difficult problem.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">What Is Subtraction?</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          Subtraction is taking away numbers or different items to determine what is left.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Imagine that you have 8 pieces of candy, and then you give your friend 4 pieces. How many pieces do you have left?
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          We'll create a subtraction problem to find the answer. First, we'll identify the minuend, which is the number we start with.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The minuend for this problem is 8, because that's how many pieces of candy you had at the start. So we can begin creating our subtraction problem: 8 - 
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Next, we'll identify the subtrahend, which is the number that we're subtracting from the minuend. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The subtrahend for this problem is 4 because that's how many pieces of candy are being taken away from our original amount of 8. With this information, we can update our subtraction problem to: 8 - 4 = 
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Now, all we have to do is find how much we have left or the difference. We can solve the problem by subtracting the subtrahend from the minuend: 8 - 4 = 4
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The key to mastering subtraction is to memorize subtracting the numbers from 0-10, just like with addition. This will give you a solid foundation and allow you to solve any difficult problem.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">What Is Multiplication?</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          Multiplication is adding the same number multiple times to find the total.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Imagine that you have 2 packs of baseball cards, and each pack contains 4 cards. How many cards do you have?
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          We'll create a multiplication problem to find the answer. First, we'll identify the factors, which are the numbers that get multiplied together.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The factors of this problem are 2 and 4, so we can begin creating our multiplication problem: 2 x 4 = 
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Now, all we have to do is find the total number of cards we have or the product. We can solve the problem by finding the product of the factors: 2 x 4 = 8
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Once again, the key to mastering multiplication is to memorize multiplying the numbers from 0-10. This will give you a solid foundation and allow you to solve any difficult problem.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">What Is Division?</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          Division is splitting a number or group of items into equal parts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Imagine that you have 6 slices of pizza, and you want to know how many slices you and your friend can each have so that you both get the same number of slices. How many slices will you both be able to eat?
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          We'll create a division problem to find the answer. First, we'll identify the dividend, which is the number that we start with.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The dividend for this problem is 6, because that's how many slices of pizza you have in total. So we can begin creating our division problem: 6 / 
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Next, we'll identify the divisor, which is the number that we're dividing from the dividend.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The divisor for this problem is 2 because that number of people will be taking an equal share from our original amount of 6. With this information, we can update our division problem: to 6 / 2 =
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          Now, all we have to do is find how much the 2 groups get, or the quotient. We can solve the problem by dividing the dividend by the divisor: 6 / 2 = 3
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The key to mastering division is to think of it as the inverse of multiplication. If you can build a solid base for your multiplication facts skills, then division will become easier.

      <h2 class="text-heading-large">Tips For Success</h2>
      <div class="border">
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #1: Failure Is The Key</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          This game is all about learning from mistakes and seeing them as a good thing that helps you grow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          I want you to learn your math facts, but more importantly, I want you to have a strong mindset that helps you succeed in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          The game is designed to help you practice and get better as quickly as possible. That means that sometimes the questions will get hard, and you might not get them right at first. But that’s okay. That's how you learn.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          When things get tough, it shows that you are moving in the right direction and getting better.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
          If you can learn to see mistakes as a chance to learn, you’ll not only get good at your math facts, but you’ll also be on the path to success for the rest of your life.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #2: Just Breathe</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          When things get hard, it’s easy to feel frustrated and want to give up.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            One way to help with this is to practice taking deep breaths to feel calmer and better.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            If you can calm down and focus, facing challenges will be easier, and you will get better at facing them!
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            I want to teach you a breathing technique called the 3-3-3 technique. First, sit up straight in your chair and close your eyes gently. Take a deep breath in through your nose for 3 seconds. Then, hold your breath for 3 seconds, and finally, slowly let the air out through your mouth for 3 seconds.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            Do this breathing exercise 5 to 10 times, and you will feel more relaxed and ready to face whatever comes next.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #3: Set Limits</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          It's important to work hard in order to learn, but you also need to know when to take a break.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            If you start to feel frustrated and stuck, even after reviewing how to do the operation you're on and practicing your deep breaths, it’s a good idea to take a break.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            Taking a break is completely okay. Your brain needs some rest to get ready for more learning.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            When you feel relaxed and ready again, come back to the game and see if you can do even better than before.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            You might be surprised that after a little break, the questions will feel easier, and you can go further in the game.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading-medium">Tip #4: Practice Everyday</h3>
        <p class="text-p">
          Doing something many times helps you learn new things and think in new ways. Try to play this game every day.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            It doesn’t matter if you play for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or even longer. If you love the game and want to play for an hour, that’s fantastic. Keep it up.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            If you find it hard at first and feel tired, playing for just 5 minutes is perfectly okay.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            Do whatever time feels good for you so you can get used to playing every day. You’ll get better at your own speed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            There’s no rush or end time for this game. It’s all about getting better at your own pace.
        </p>
        <p class="text-p">
            Find what works for you, and soon you’ll see how much you can grow!
