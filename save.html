        Saving is one of the best things you can do with your money. When you save, you set aside money that will grow over time just by being in a savings account. 
        Instead of spending on things like fancy clothes or the latest phone, you can watch your money grow. Saving helps you work toward big goals that will 
        benefit you in the future. If you're in elementary or middle school, you don't need to worry about opening a savings account just yet. 
        When the time comes, a parent or guardian will help you with the process. For now, just keep the idea of saving in mind so you'll be prepared when it's time to start.

            In Boundless Math, you can save your Snow just like you would with money in a savings account. When your Snow is saved, you can't spend it on packs of cards 
            right away, but over time, you'll earn extra Snow. This extra Snow will help you buy even more packs later on. You can deposit as much of your Snow as you 
            want and take it out whenever you like. Plus, your saved Snow will grow by 1% for every question you answer correctly and won't lose any value if you answer 
            a question wrong. 1% may not sound like much, but you'll see that it adds up quickly!
