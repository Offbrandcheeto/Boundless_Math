The difficulty adjusts to your performanceâ€”correct answers bring tougher problems, while incorrect ones make the problems easier. Your journey begins with addition and advances through subtraction, multiplication, and, finally division. Once you complete division, the game returns to addition and starts the cycle over again. However, the problems will be more challenging than they were in the previous cycle. Each cycle pushes you further, building your skills step by step. It'll be a challenge, but as you keep putting in the work and showing up, you'll discover that your potential is truly boundless!`;

  const welcomePromptTwo = `Congratulations on answering your first question and beginning your journey! You took the first step, which is always the hardest one, and I'd like to introduce you to two important parts of the game: the Shop and Save sections. In the Shop section, you can buy packs of cards containing different penguins you can collect. You purchase the packs using the Snow you collect when you answer a question correctly. You can also use your Snow in the Save section, where you can put some or all of it into a savings account. Doing this helps you build Snow quickly, so it's highly recommended that you do it.`

Do additional research if necessary, or ask a friend or teacher for help. Don't be afraid to ask questions or seek out help. This is how you learn, and you're doing a great job. Keep it up.";

You are really pushing yourself, and you keep showing up even in the face of tremendous difficulty. Be sure to take a look at the learn section and review the operation you are on. Do additional research if necessary, or ask a friend or teacher for help. Review the concepts and do a little bit of practice on your own. Once you've done this, return and continue playing after taking a break. Remember, you learn far more when you lose than when you win, so if you see others around you getting problems correct, don't get upset. Odds are that you are learning more than they are, and they should be jealous of you. Keep going. I believe in you and have confidence in yourself.";
